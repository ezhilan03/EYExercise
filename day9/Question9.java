//We can have whatever return type we want for main method. But JVM searches for main method with specific keywords like- public static void main(String[] args). If not JVM cannot locate the main method and the program will not run.

//The argument type of program's main method is String array.

//public static void main(String arg[]), public void main(String  [] arg) are both applicable.

//goto and const are reserved keywords which are not used yet.

//byte and import are keywords.
